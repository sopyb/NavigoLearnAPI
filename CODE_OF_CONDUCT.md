# NavigoLearn Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This commitment applies regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

NavigoLearn is a community-driven and open-source project that aims to share knowledge and experiences in programming. Our goal is to create a supportive and inclusive space where everyone can freely share their love for learning and programming.

## Our Standards

Positive behavior contributions include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism graciously
* Prioritizing the best interests of the community
* Demonstrating empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this code of conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative online or offline.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the project team at [navigolearn@gmail.com](mailto:navigolearn@gmail.com).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is considered necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions imposed by other members of the project's leadership.
