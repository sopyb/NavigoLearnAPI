## Controllers

Controllers are the handlers that respond to various HTTP requests. Each controller has different tasks, such as handling user authorization or dealing with specific database records.

- **Further Reading**: [Controllers Documentation](./controllers.md) (To be added)

## Types
Types are used to define the structure of various data entities (like Users or Events) and their relationships.

### Models

Models define the structure of the various data entities (like Users or Events), their relationships, and also the methods to interact with the database.

- **Further Reading**: [Models Classes Documentation](./models.md) (To be added)

### Responses

Responses classes are used to send data back to the client in a consistent format.

- **Further Reading**: [Responses Classes Documentation](./responses.md) (To be added)

## Helpers

Helpers are used to perform various tasks so that the controllers are not bloated with code that might change.

- **Further Reading**: [Helpers Documentation](./helpers.md) (To be added)

### Database Management

Database management helpers are used to perform various tasks related to the database.

- **Further Reading**: [Database Management Documentation](./database_management.md) (To be added)

### Response Management

Response management helpers are used to format the response JSON sent back to the client. This usually uses [Responses classes](#responses) 

## Routes

Routes decide how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

This uses [Controllers](#controllers) 

- **Further Reading**: [Routes Documentation](./routes.md) (To be added)

## Middleware

Middleware functions have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

- **Further Reading**: [Middleware Documentation](./middleware.md) (To be added)

### Validators

Validators are middlewares used to check the integrity of incoming data before it's processed by the application.

- **Further Reading**: [Validators Documentation](./validators.md) (To be added)

## Utilities

Utility functions and classes provide useful features used across the application.

- **Further Reading**: [Utility Documentation](./utilities.md) (To be added)

Remember, understanding the codebase's architecture is crucial for making meaningful contributions or understanding how to resolve issues. You are encouraged to explore each section in detail.

## SQL

SQL files are used to create and update the database schema. They are also used to create stored procedures and functions for creating dummy data.

- **Further Reading**: [SQL Documentation](./sql.md) (To be added)
